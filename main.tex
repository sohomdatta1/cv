\begin{rSection}{Open source experience}
\begin{rSubsection}{ \bf Lead maintainer, ProofreadPage}{ \em October 2021 -- Present }{Wikimedia Foundation}{}
\item Helped in maintaining the infrastructure for the ProofreadPage extension, which adds proofreading capabilities to MediaWiki and is deployed in over 70 production wikis managed by Wikimedia. (80+ major patches)
\item Improved developer documentation related to the extension, providing guides and detailed walkthroughs regarding its setup and use to help ease the onboarding process for new developers.
\item Introduced Selenium integration tests across the ProofreadPage codebase to better validate critical frontend changes.
\item Took initiative in overhauling the preload and caching mechanism provided by ProofreadPage to decrease load times for editor-facing components.
\item Built EditInSequence, a community requested feature that allows users to edit multiple pages via a fast and easy to use interface.
\end{rSubsection}
\begin{rSubsection}{\bf Google Summer of Code mentor, Wikimedia Foundation}{\em March 2021 -- Sep 2021}{Google Summer of Code}{}

   \item {\bf Fuzzing sudo} - Performed a fuzzing campaign on sudo, and found latent use-after-frees, out-of-bound reads and integer overflows. (sudo-project/sudo \texttt{Issue\#198}, \texttt{PR\#196}, \texttt{PR\#218}, \texttt{PR\#227} )
   \item {\bf Pagelist Widget (GSoC project)} - Developed a Javascript (ES5) based custom widget that allowed users to interact with a representation of the ''pagelist syntax`` (a syntax based on XML tags) graphically. Additionally, implemented heuristic logic that translated user inputs back into the ''pagelist syntax``.

\item {\bf Software sandbox using seccomp-bpf} - Developed a toy process sandbox using the kernel seccomp API that enabled users to selectively allow and deny specific sequences of syscall usages that were considered malicious according to a set of heuristics rules.
\item {\bf Dis, a stack based language } - Developed a compiler in Typescript for a toy stack-based language that used polish notation to perform arithmetic operations and compiled into x86 assembly.
\item {\bf Djikstra's pathfinding algorithm in Python} - Developed a distributed system of nodes that dynamically computed the best path inside a maze using the publisher-subscriber model provided by the Robotic Operating System (ROS)
